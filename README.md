## Features

- YOLOv5/YOLOv8 implementation for skin cancer detection
- Support for multiple classes of skin lesions
- Customizable model architecture
- Training and evaluation scripts
- Export to various formats (ONNX, TFLite, etc.)
- Comprehensive metrics visualization

## Dataset

The model is trained on the [ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset](https://www.isic-archive.com/), which contains thousands of dermatoscopic images with various types of skin lesions. The dataset includes:

- Melanoma
- Melanocytic nevus
- Basal cell carcinoma
- Actinic keratosis
- Benign keratosis
- Dermatofibroma
- Vascular lesion

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alishan45/SkinCancerClassification.git
cd SkinCancerClassification
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Inference on single image
```python
python detect.py --weights best.pt --source test_image.jpg
```

### Webcam demo
```python
python detect.py --weights best.pt --source 0
```

## Training

To train the model on your custom dataset:

1. Prepare your dataset in YOLO format
2. Modify the configuration file (`data/skin_cancer.yaml`)
3. Run the training script:
```python
python train.py --img 640 --batch 32 --epochs 30 --data data/skin_cancer.yaml --cfg models/yolov5s.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
```

## Evaluation

Evaluate the model performance:
```python
python val.py --weights best.pt --data data/skin_cancer.yaml --img 640
```

## Results

Performance metrics on the test set:

| Metric       | Value   |
|--------------|---------|
| Precision    | 0.89    |
| Recall       | 0.85    |
| mAP@0.5      | 0.87    |
| mAP@0.5:0.95 | 0.62    |
