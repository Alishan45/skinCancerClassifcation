SkinCancerClassification
A deep learning project for detecting and classifying skin cancer lesions using YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework. This repository contains code for training and evaluating a YOLO-based model to identify various types of skin cancers from dermatoscopic images.

Skin Cancer Classification using YOLO
Project Banner

This repository contains an implementation of a YOLO (You Only Look Once) based model for detecting and classifying skin cancer lesions from dermatoscopic images. The project aims to assist in early detection of skin cancers, which is crucial for effective treatment.

Dataset
The model is trained on the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset, which contains thousands of dermatoscopic images with various types of skin lesions. The dataset includes:

Melanoma
Melanocytic nevus
Basal cell carcinoma
Actinic keratosis
Benign keratosis
Dermatofibroma
Vascular lesion
Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SkinCancerClassification.git
cd SkinCancerClassification
Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Inference on single image
python detect.py --weights best.pt --source test_image.jpg
Webcam demo
python detect.py --weights best.pt --source 0
Training
To train the model on your custom dataset:

Prepare your dataset in YOLO format
Modify the configuration file (data/skin_cancer.yaml)
Run the training script:
python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data data/skin_cancer.yaml --cfg models/yolov5s.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
Evaluation
Evaluate the model performance:

python val.py --weights best.pt --data data/skin_cancer.yaml --img 640
Results
Performance metrics on the test set:

Metric	Value
